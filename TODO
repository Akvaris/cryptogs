[ ] loader comes up right after transaction, is dismissable, and has a link to the tx on etherscan
    (the button you pushed to get the window should go gray)
    (even if it is dismissable, if you have a pending tx the loader should float and stick to a corner so you can pull it up)
      -because sometimes it takes so long you forget you are waiting and try to fire off another one
      (it also needs to handle and ERROR by probably still forwarding to the page it means to go to?
        could you continue to query the status of the tx for a minutes?)
[ ] mobile responsive, viewport, test in cipher browser
[ ] game log should be more toward the top right and should include events like coin flip result and final count
[ ] rarity display for single pog and entire stack
[ ] 40 might be too short for a TIMEOUTBLOCKS
[ ] adjust gas limits so they are as accurate as possible without running out
[ ] make sure metamask looks good in every state
[ ] contracts may be able to clean up a lot of their storage when a game finishes
[ ] cryptog page
[ ] some kind of GWEI slider instead of hardcoded
[ ] cryptog hover action
[ ] cryptog images should be in their own folder
[ ] loader component
[ ] button style
[ ] clean up animations
[ ] audit contracts
[ ] is this legal?
[ ] privacy policy and terms of usage
[ ] team/about page
[ ] register social accounts
[ ] ipfs link for fully decentralized
[ ] contracts published and verified
[ ] do a write up about why things take a long time and why so many transactions are needed for random
  (then you can link to that when they are sitting there waiting for coin flip etc)

[ ] you need to be able to revoke a stack - if someone submits a counter and then days later it is accepted, the other player could drain it after the coinflip

gameplay
-----
[ ] make sure you can drain and no one else can after the 40 block time out window
[ ] make sure the onlyOwner actions are for sure only able to be run by the owner
[ ] look through each tx with a fresh mind and double check the funtionality
